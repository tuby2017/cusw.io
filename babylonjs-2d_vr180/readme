Gui does not work, video height over 2048 px won't work either. Video 
plays in loop. Mouse drag, scroll, arrow keys to move the camera. Slight
 edit to use 'a' for play/pause but do few dragging on the video first. 
Video splits in top/bottom changes halfDomeMode to false.
 Same w/ momoscopic video, but result looks like barrel distortion when 
zoomed out is much drastic. 6500 kb/s average video bitrate looks good 
under sufficient lighting, 23-30 fps is good enough.
